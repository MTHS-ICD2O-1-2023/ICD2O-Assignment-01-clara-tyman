  <blockquote>"To me programming is more than an important practical art. It is also a gigantic undertaking in the
    foundations of knowledge."</blockquote>

  <blockquote>"The most important thing I've accomplished, other than building the compiler, is training young people.
    They come to me, you know, and say, 'Do you think we can do this?' I say, "Try it." And I back 'em up. They need
    that. I keep track of them as they get older and I stir 'em up at intervals so they don't forget to take chances.”

      <p class="description">Problems with the Mark I led to the discovery that a moth was disrupting the machine. Grace
        logged, "First actual case of bug being found". This encouraged the use of the term computer bug.</p>
